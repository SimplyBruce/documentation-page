    <p>A drug is a chemical that interacts with proteins in the body to affect a physiological function. This is the general idea behind all medicine. Once these chemicals are absorbed into the systemic circulation they bind with certain proteins and this changes the functioning of the cell slightly. For example, anticancer drugs bind to proteins on the surface of cancer cells this stimulates the cells to die. In this case cell death is the physiological action of the drug.</p>
    <p> No drugs are specific to interacting with just one type of cell or one type of protein and this is what causes side effects. Again using an anticancer drug as an example, the medication works by binding to very rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, however hair cells are also rapidly dividing and that is why one of the side effects of anticancer drugs is hair loss. </p>

    <header>How do they work</header>
    <p> Our bodies are largely controlled by proteins. Proteins exist in many different forms in the body and have many different functions. Each protein has a specific function and is quite specific to the cell type that it acts on. For example, there are specific types of proteins called receptors. Receptors are embedded on the cell surfaces, there are different receptors for different types of cells. A liver cell will have different receptors than a cardiac cell. The receptor binds to other proteins and chemicals on the outside of the cell and this in turn creates a change in the functioning of the cell. </p>
    <p>Proteins also act as drug targets. In order for a drug to exert an effect it needs to be bound to a protein. This can be thought of as a lock and key system; where the drugs are the key and the protein is the lock. Once the drug is bound in this lock and key mechanism it can have one of two main influences over the cell. It can produce a change in response or it can stop a normal response of the cell. </p>
    <p> Drugs that produce a change in the cell functioning are called agonists. Drugs that stop a normal function of the cell are called antagonists. </p>

    <header>Cannabis</header>
    <p>Cannabis, also known as marijuana among other names, is a psychoactive drug from the Cannabis plant used primarily for medical or recreational purposes. The main psychoactive component of cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is one of the 483 known compounds in the plant, including at least 65 other cannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD). </p> 
      <p> Cannabis can be used by smoking, vaporizing, within food or as an extract, here are some of the most famous types of Cannabis.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Cannabis sativa</li>
      <li>Cannabis indica</li>
      <li>White widow</li>
      <li>Quebec gold</li>

    <header>Cocaine</header>
    <p>Cocaine, also known as coke, is a strong stimulant most frequently used as a recreational drug. It is commonly snorted, inhaled as smoke, or dissolved and injected into a vein. Mental effects may include an intense feeling of happiness, sexual arousal, loss of contact with reality, or agitation. Physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and large pupils. High doses can result in very high blood pressure or body temperature. Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes.</p>
    <p>Cocaine has a small number of accepted medical uses, such as numbing and decreasing bleeding during nasal surgery.</p>

    <header>Alcohol</header>
    <p>Alcohol, sometimes referred to by the chemical name ethanol, is a psychoactive drug that is the active ingredient in drinks such as beer, wine, and distilled spirits (hard liquor). It is one of the oldest and most common recreational substances, causing the characteristic effects of alcohol intoxication ("drunkenness"). Among other effects, alcohol produces a mood lift and euphoria, decreased anxiety, increased sociability, sedation, impairment of cognitive, memory, motor, and sensory function, and generalized depression of central nervous system function. Ethanol is only one of several types of alcohol, but it is the only type of alcohol that is found in alcoholic beverages or commonly used for recreational purposes; other alcohols such as methanol and isopropyl alcohol are significantly more toxic. A mild, brief exposure to isopropanol, being only moderately more toxic than ethanol, is unlikely to cause any serious harm. Methanol, being profoundly more toxic than ethanol, is lethal in quantities as small as 10-15 milliliters (2-3 tsp).</p>
